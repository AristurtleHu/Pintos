# Pintos

Pintos is a simple operating system framework designed for the 80x86 architecture. This educational platform serves as a foundation for implementing and understanding key OS concepts.

## Overview

Pintos currently supports:

- Kernel threads
- Loading and running user programs
- Virtual memory
- A basic file system

All of these features are implemented in a minimal, straightforward manner, providing an excellent starting point for enhancement and learning.

## Project Goals

As part of the course, project teams will strengthen Pintos by:

1. Enhancing the thread system
2. Improving user program support
3. Implementing virtual memory
4. Expanding the file system capabilities

The first one is implemented in branch "project1", while the rest is implemented in branch "main".

## Execution Environment

While Pintos could theoretically run on a standard IBM-compatible PC, for practical reasons in the course, it runs in system simulators that accurately emulate an 80x86 CPU and its peripheral devices. The supported simulators include:

- Bochs
- QEMU
- VMware Player (tested)

These simulators allow students to develop and test their Pintos implementations without requiring dedicated hardware.
